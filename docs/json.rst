Djata produces and consumes JSON data in several ways.

- formatted when HTTP GET used on a model or object URL.
- parsed when PUT or POST to a model or object URL.
- parsed from the "json" query string option or POST encoded request as an
  alternative to URL encoded request parameters.

Read more about these formats in the `REST schema <rest.rst>`_ documentation.
