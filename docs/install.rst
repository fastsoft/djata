Djata is built on Django.  The ``djata`` directory must be copied or moved
somewhere onto the ``PYTHONPATH`` like ``/usr/lib/python/site-packages/``.

Optionally, installing the following modules will enable corresponding
features:

- ``pyExcelerator`` for Excel format (automatically available on all views when
  the module is installed)
- ``minidetector`` for detecting and negotiating content for mobile
  devices (not currently used)
